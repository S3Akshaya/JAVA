/* Most programmers will tell you that one of the ways to improve your performance in competitive programming is to practice a lot of problems.

Our Chef took the above advice very seriously and decided to set a target for himself.

Chef decides to solve at least 10 problems every week for  4 weeks.
Given the number of problems he actually solved in each week over 4 weeks as a,b,c,d
â€‹
 , output the number of weeks in which Chef met his target. */
