/* IPL Ticket Rush
DAIICT college students want to attend an IPL match.

A total of 
N
N students from the college want to go while only 
M
M tickets are available for the match.

Determine how many students won't be able to book tickets.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer 
T
T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of two space-separated integers 
N
N and 
M
M â€” the number of students wants to go and the total number of tickets available, respectively. There are 
5
5 students who want to go, and only 
3
3 tickets are available. Hence 
2
2 students won't be able to get tickets.  There are 
8
8 students who want to go, and 
8
8 tickets are available. So, every one of them will get the tickets.  */
